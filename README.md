# 📈 ML4BankGrowth

**ML4BankGrowth** is a proprietary machine learning project created to **predict lending rates** for banks using historical, regional, and economic data.  
It demonstrates the complete workflow of a real-world ML project — from data analysis and feature selection to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## 🚀 What This Repository Does

This project:
1. Loads and prepares a proprietary banking dataset
2. Analyzes the data to uncover relationships between factors and lending rates
3. Uses **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to select important inputs
4. Trains a **Ridge** model to predict lending rates
5. Saves trained model artifacts for reuse
6. Deploys an interactive **Streamlit web app** for viewing predictions
